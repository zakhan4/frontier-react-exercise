## My thoughts on the exercise
I found the exercise really interesting, as the components creation was dynamic depending on the data inside 'form_instructions.json' file. Although the selection of which components to create was pretty straight-forward, it took me a while to decide what kind of state structure would be suitable for the exercise. I did not spend too much time in styling the components, as I didn't think that was the focus of this exercise. It took me approximately 10 hours to get the project in this state.
